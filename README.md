`SBA 316: The Document Object Model`

```The Objectives of the current project are, among others, to```:
- assess our skills in using DOM properties, methods and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience and, 
- to demonstrate our proficiency with event-driven programming and implementing HTML and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

Tools used: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript

Approach:

The website is built from scratch using some HTML initial pages. Some components of the final HTML pages are prepared added into the DOM dynamically using JavaScript. The comments in the JavaScript script provide some context on the development process.

```What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?```
- Overall, I am satisfied with the overall planning and execution of this project. For the relatively short amount of time that I had, I managed to execute almost all of the functionalities that I wanted to include in the webpage. With more time, and more techniques that I learn in the future, I can make the website even more interactive and more functional. 


```Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?```

I did not have any particular difficulty in implementing what was required. I made a lot of research to understand the tools that I used, which made the project fun and educational!

```What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?```
I would finish the two additional pages that I planned to have and I will include more interactivity.

Note to self: start small and expand on additional features as you go!
